# Customer Bookings Prediction - A Deep Learning based approach
#### By Arunava Kumar Chakraborty
Please follow the following steps to run the application on the local server.

1. Run all the code from the **.ipynb** file to build the sequential model.
2. Run the **app.py** file to start the flask application in the local server.
3. Go to the server to see the running webpage.
4. Fill the values of all the independent variables to predict the customer booking.
5. After testing the given data using the model (**model.pkl**) the app will predict whether the customer is going to be checked in or not.
